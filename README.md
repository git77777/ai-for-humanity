# 🌌 AI for Humanity

## 🌍 Mission
To design and build technologies that ensure the **safe and ethical evolution of artificial intelligence**, empowering humanity to thrive intelligently and responsibly, on Earth and beyond.

I believe AI should not replace human wisdom, but **amplify it**.  
My mission is to create tools, systems, and ideas that make artificial intelligence **transparent, trustworthy, and aligned** with human values.  
Every line of code I write moves toward a future where technology serves *life itself* — advancing science, ethics, and exploration together.

## 🚀 Vision
A future where **humanity and artificial intelligence grow as one** — ethically guided, scientifically driven, and capable of reaching the stars.

I envision a civilization that:
- Uses AI not for dominance, but for **understanding**  
- Builds machines that **respect life and curiosity**  
- Expands into space with **wisdom, empathy, and scientific clarity**  

Through AI Safety, Space Science, and open collaboration,  
I aim to contribute to the next phase of human evolution —  
one where intelligence is not just powerful, but **conscious of its responsibility**.

## 🧠 Project Concept
This repository contains my first step toward this mission:

### **AI Ethics Evaluator (Web App)**
A tool to analyze AI-generated text for:
- Bias  
- Toxicity  
- Manipulative or unsafe content  

It demonstrates how AI can be guided **ethically**, even in complex scenarios — from everyday language models to advanced AI used in science and space exploration.
